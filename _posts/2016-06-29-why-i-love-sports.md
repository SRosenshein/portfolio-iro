title: Why I Love Sports Today
---

I’ve always loved sports. From watching sports with family and friends as a child to playing football and basketball up until I graduated high school, sports have always been a huge part of my life. The pure competition and fun as well as the hard work and camaraderie necessary to be successful make it something truly unique. Still, it wasn’t until one specific life experience where I discovered the true power of sports and what inspired me to change lives through sports as a career. Sports have the power to bring entire communities together for something positive and give people something to be proud of like nothing else can. 

In September of 2012, I, along with thousands of other kids around America, was moving out of my childhood home for the first time to start college in a whole new environment. For me, I was leaving my quiet and small New Jersey suburban lifestyle for Boston University, a school located in the heart of the city of Boston. Although wide-eyed and anxious, I was excited to experience a new world on my own in a brand-new city that I now consider my second home. 

Fast forward only a few months to April of 2013. The Boston Marathon Bombings. As a freshman in college, I spent the whole month excited to celebrate this amazing event in my new city along with all my new friends only for it to end in tragedy. I did not know any of the victims personally but I could only think about what might have been considering I was at the finish line only hours before the bombings. In fact, a part of the marathon course runs right through BU’s campus. 

I still remember that day as well as watching police and swat teams from my dorm room the following days during their manhunt for the two suspects as if it happened yesterday. Although the next few months were somber, I saw first-hand how strong the people of Boston were and how resilient they were to help out in any way they could by volunteering their time through hundreds of organizations throughout the city.

Fast forward once again to October 30, 2013: the Boston Red Sox are in Game 6 of the World Series up 3-2. I was at the game along with 19 of my friends volunteering for Red Sox Green Team, a program where students and other organizations find and collect recyclable trash throughout Fenway Park that would otherwise be thrown away and ensure that they properly get recycled.

The whole stadium erupts in joy and this moment, to me, was the defining image of Boston Strong. To see the players and the entire city come together the way they did so shortly after a tragedy, to finally have something to cheer for together so emphatically, is something I will never forget and can only be possible through something as powerful and unpredictable as sports. I couldn’t be happier nor more proud to be a part of the Boston community in that moment and I will probably never give so many hugs to complete strangers as I did that day in Fenway Park.

A moment that special comes only ever so often but there are still so many similar stories about the power and magic of sports. I aspire to help any sports organization, whether a major professional franchise or the local youth sports league, to create moments like the ones I experienced ever since that day. Sports bring people together, give people something to proudly work tirelessly for, and simply have the power unlike anything else to change lives for the better.
