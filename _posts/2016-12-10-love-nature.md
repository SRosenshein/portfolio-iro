title: Love Nature As Much As Tech
---

Technology is a beautiful thing. It allows you to design beautiful digital worlds, create machines to simplfy and solve problems, and develop programs to help people make the world a better place. Still, it is just as essential to appreciate a whole different kind of beauty: nature. Some people love seeing the waves crash in front of a sunset-illuminated beach and others love gazing into the starry night sky imaginging what worlds exist out in the distance. For me? I love slapping two planks of wood on my feet and soaring through snowy mountain ranges like the ones seen in this recent photo from Big Sky, Montana:

I love writing code. It makes me feel creative, constructive, and innovative. But sometimes, you just need to put the smartphone and laptop down and just get away from it all. When I go skiing, I feel like I can fly. (Except for when I miss the landing and fall face-first into the snow. That's a video clip for another day.)
