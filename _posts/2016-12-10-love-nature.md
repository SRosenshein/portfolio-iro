title: Love Nature As Much As Tech
---

Technology is a wonderful thing. It allows you to design beautiful digital worlds, create machines to simplfy and solve problems, and develop programs to help people make the world a better place. Still, it is just as essential to appreciate a whole different kind of beauty: nature. Some people love seeing the waves crash in front of a sunset-illuminated beach and others love gazing into the starry night sky imaginging what worlds exist out in the distance. For me? I love slapping two planks of wood on my feet and soaring through snowy mountain ranges like the ones seen in this recent photo from Big Sky, Montana:

I love writing code. It makes me feel creative, constructive, and innovative. But sometimes, you just need to put the smartphone and laptop down and just get away from it all. When I go skiing, I feel like I can fly. I have been fortunate to visit beautiful ski resorts such as Killington Vermont, Mont Tremblant Montreal, Big Sky Montana, Vail Colorado, and Park City Utah and I strive to continue being able to see more. 

This post was a purposely short one as I simply believe it is important for everyone to find their own ideal natural escape and enjoy it whenever possible with all of their passion. My escape is to ski through massive snow-capped mountains and trees in various places around the world. So find what you love to do, save your work, and get out there!
