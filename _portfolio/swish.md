# Summary

Have you ever wanted to play a a few games of pickup basketball with friends either for fun or exercise, show up to the court, and see it completely empty and end up making layups for 10 minutes and leaving? It's a terrible feeling and not to mention a total waste of time. Swish is a real-time pickup basketball court finder web app that allows users to request the status of a court from other users to know if its crowded, empty, or perfect to get a few good games in. Pickup basketball players are a huge community so why not work together to make the game more fun?

The app is built upon a Ruby on Rails custom API backend with a React/Redux frontend framework. The purpose of the project is to expand upon my foundational understanding of the React library by incorportaing third-party technologies such as Redux/Redux-Sagas, Webpack, and Axios (for generating API requests from custom backend). Also, the app demonstrates my knowledge of pulling and priming data from APIs and outside sources to be used in the app as seen in the requests from my own API, the Google Maps Javascript API, and NYC court data provided by [NYC Parks](https://www.nycgovparks.org/facilities/basketball "NYC Dep of Parks and Rec").

Swish currently only handles New York City basketball court data but will eventually be expanded to multiple cities.

Swish is my current project and I intend to update this page as I progress further. My code will constantly be pushed up to Github.
